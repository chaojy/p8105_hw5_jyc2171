  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_color_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(hom_total)
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 50 x 2
    ##    city_state        hom_total
    ##    <chr>                 <int>
    ##  1 Tampa_FL                208
    ##  2 Savannah_GA             246
    ##  3 San Bernardino_CA       275
    ##  4 Durham_NC               276
    ##  5 Denver_CO               312
    ##  6 Minneapolis_MN          366
    ##  7 Sacramento_CA           376
    ##  8 Albuquerque_NM          378
    ##  9 Long Beach_CA           378
    ## 10 Omaha_NE                409
    ## # … with 40 more rows

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>%  filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>%  pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>%  filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>%  pull(hom_total))
```

    ## 
    ##  1-sample proportions test with continuity correction
    ## 
    ## data:  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved) out of aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total), null probability 0.5
    ## X-squared = 239.01, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.6275625 0.6631599
    ## sample estimates:
    ##         p 
    ## 0.6455607

So can repeat this for each city\_state - this is an iteration issue The
input is city\_state

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>%  filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>%  pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>%  filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>%  pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try t0 iterate ……… Try to create a fourth column that has the data that
is requested in homework assignment

``` r
#conceptually, this is the framework:
#aggregate_df %>% 
#  mutate(
#    prop_tests = map( ....... )
#  )

results_df =
aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)  
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
# this is an alternate way to approach
# city_prop_tst = function(df) {
  
#  n_unsolved ...
#  n_total ...

#  prop.test(........)  
  
#}

homicide_df =
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

## Problem 2 ideas …

import one dataset

``` r
data_1 = read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),
    ##   week_2 = col_double(),
    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

but the challenge is how to do it across the 10 subjects in the contorl
group and 10 subjects in control group?

start with a dataframe with the names of all of your names

``` r
path_df =
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
##    data = map(.................)) 
## if you can do this, then you would solve this part of the homework assignment
## then after this, you can do some mutate stuff
## probably need to pivot to made the dataset tidy
## could I get the actual dataframe I wanted to have to do some analysis or some plots
## this is a data organizational problem and data tidying problem
## in the end, everything will be in one dataframe
  )

read_csv(path_df$path[[1]])
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   week_1 = col_double(),
    ##   week_2 = col_double(),
    ##   week_3 = col_double(),
    ##   week_4 = col_double(),
    ##   week_5 = col_double(),
    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   week_1 week_2 week_3 week_4 week_5 week_6 week_7 week_8
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1    0.2  -1.31   0.66   1.96   0.23   1.09   0.05   1.94

``` r
## now how to do this read csv across all 20 paths?
## can have each of the csv's stored
```

# Problem 3
